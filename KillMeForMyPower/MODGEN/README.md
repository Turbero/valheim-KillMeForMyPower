The Kill Me For My Power mod contains several features to block new players that want to take shortcuts in servers or local games.

Feature: block obtaining the forsaken powers without killing them first. Useful in servers to force new players to have the full biome experience!
* Scare the cheeky players that attempt to obtain the powers of enemies not killed yet by them with little damage effects.
* Custom the messages in your own language

Feature: lock vendors even if you find them too soon until you kill the corresponding forsakens! Choose the boss to unlock them. By default:
* Haldor: need to defeat Eikthyr before buying anything
* Hildir: need to defeat Eikthyr before buying anything
* Bog Witch: need to defeat The Elder before buying anything

(NEW!) Feature: restrict leveling up more than the indicated level in the configuration before killing each boss. Examples:
* set up that before killing Eikthyr you can only level up skills until 20
* set up that before killing The Elder you can only level up skills until 35
* and so on. It's configurable for each existing boss

Remove these restrictions, leave them or add more to your choice. When it is not possible to buy anything to a vendor a yellow message will pop up on screen, meaning it is still locked.

Change the necessary boss to your choice before showing up in the vending list. Also select individual items to lock. By default:
* Thunderstone: need to defeat The Elder
* Ymir meat: need to defeat The Elder
* Chicken egg: need to defeat Yagluth
