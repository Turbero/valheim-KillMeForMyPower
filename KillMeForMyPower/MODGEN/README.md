The Kill Me For My Power mod blocks new players that want to obtain the forsaken powers without killing them first. Useful in servers to force new players to have the full experience without shortcuts!
* Scare the cheeky players that attempt to obtain the powers of enemies not killed yet by them.
* Custom the message

Also lock vendors even if you find them too soon until you kill the corresponding forsakens! By default:
* Haldor: need to defeat Eikthyr before buying anything
* Hildir: need to defeat Eikthyr before buying anything
* Bog Witch: need to defeat The Elder before buying anything

Change the necessary boss to your choice. Also by default:
* Thunderstore: need to defeat The Elder before showing up in the vending list
* Ymir meat: need to defeat The Elder before showing up in the vending list
* Chicken egg: need to defeat Yagluth before showing up in the vending list

Remove these restrictions, leave them or add more to your choice.

When it is not possible to buy anything to a vendor a yellow message will pop up on screen, meaning it is still locked.
